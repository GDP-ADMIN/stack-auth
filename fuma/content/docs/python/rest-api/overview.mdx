Stack offers a REST API for backends & frontends of any programming language or framework. This API is used to authenticate users, manage user data, and more.

## Authentication

The following authentication headers are common to every endpoint:

```http
curl https://api.stack-auth.com/api/v1/ \
     -H "X-Stack-Access-Type: <either 'client' or 'server'>" \
     -H "X-Stack-Project-Id: <your project UUID>" \
     -H "X-Stack-Publishable-Client-Key: pck_<your publishable client key>" \
     -H "X-Stack-Secret-Server-Key: ssk_<your secret server key>" \
     -H "X-Stack-Access-Token: <the current user's access token>"
```

| Header | Type | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ----------- |
| `X-Stack-Access-Type` | "client" \| "server" | Required. "client" (without quotes) for the frontend API, or "server" for the backend API. |
| `X-Stack-Project-Id` | UUID | Required. The project ID as found on the Stack dashboard. |
| `X-Stack-Publishable-Client-Key` | string | Required for client access. The API key as found on the Stack dashboard. |

| `X-Stack-Access-Token` | string | Optional. The access token for the current user. If not given, the request is considered to be logged out. |
